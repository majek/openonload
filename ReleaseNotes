OpenOnload-201710-u1.1
======================

This is a minor update release that adds support for recent kernels
(up to v4.16) to allow use of Onload with kernels that have
CONFIG_RETPOLINE enabled.

It also supports enterprise distribution kernels that have backported
and enabled CONFIG_RETPOLINE.

This package is supported on:
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 - 6.9
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 - 7.5*
 - SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 sp4
 - SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 sp2, sp3
 - Canonical Ubuntu Server LTS 14.04, 16.04
 - Canonical Ubuntu Server 17.10
 - Debian 8 "Jessie"
 - Debian 9 "Stretch"
 - Linux kernels 3.0 - 4.16

* At time of writing RHEL 7.5 is in beta but we don't expect any
relevant changes before it is released as GA.


OpenOnload-201710-u1
====================

This is a minor update release that adds support for recent kernels
(up to v4.14.11) to allow use of Onload with kernels that have KPTI.

It also supports enterprise distribution kernels for RHEL7 and SLES12
that have backported KPTI.


OpenOnload-201710
=================

This is a major feature release that adds new features to OpenOnload
and reworks some existing functionality.

A brief summary of new features and known limitations is included
below - for more details see the Onload user guide.

See the accompanying ChangeLog for a list of bugs fixed.


Linux distribution support
--------------------------
 
This package is supported on:
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 - 6.9
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 - 7.4
 - SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 sp4
 - SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 sp2, sp3
 - Canonical Ubuntu Server LTS 14.04, 16.04
 - Canonical Ubuntu Server 17.04
 - Debian 8 "Jessie"
 - Debian 9 "Stretch"
 - Linux kernels 3.0 - 4.13


ScaleOut Onload
---------------

ScaleOut Onload is a new Onload NIC licence that is optimised for use
in applications where latency is not critical.  Efficiency of packet
processing and throughput are prioritised over latency.


Control Plane Server
--------------------

As part of the changes to add support for network namespaces, and to
avoid our kernel modules "tainting" the kernel, Onload now uses a
user-space control plane server daemon.

One onload_cp_server process will be spawned per network namespace in
which there is an active Onload stack.  This process is spawned when
the first stack is created in a namespace, and stack-creation will
wait for the process to be ready, which can result in a noticeable
delay.  To avoid this delay in the majority of cases Onload will spawn
a control plane server for the default (main) network namespace at
load time.

The onload_cp_server process for a namespace will exit after a "grace
period" has elapsed after the last stack in a namespace has been
destroyed.  If a new stack is created in the same namespace before the
grace period has elapsed, it will use the existing onload_cp_server
and will not experience the delay at stack- creation.  The grace
period can be controlled using the "cplane_server_grace_timeout"
module option to the "onload" kernel module.

The compiler architecture (x86_64, i686) of the onload_cp_server
process should match that of the kernel in the host.

A new tool "onload_mibdump" has been added to access current state of
the control plane.  This provides similar information (although
differently formatted) to that which was previously available in
/proc/driver/onload_cplane/mib-*

The cplane server ipif-max configuration parameter is not handled
correctly if set to more than 256.  This leads to traffic not being
correctly accelerated.  This will be addressed in a future release.

If downgrading Onload version from a new one (201710 or later) to an
old one (201606-u1.3 or earlier) the onload_tool script from the old
version will not know about the onload_cp_server and how to stop it.
It is recommended that "onload_tool unload" from the newer version is
run before "onload_uninstall", as otherwise "onload_tool reload" after
downgrading will fail to unload the existing drivers.


Namespaces
----------

This release allows Onload to correctly operate in multiple network
namespaces.  Other namespace types are also supported.  There are some
limitations to this, and Onload does not support:

- multiple interfaces with the same IP address
- multiple interfaces with the same MAC address
- processes changing namespace after creating or sharing an Onload stack
- stack sharing between namespaces
- multicast in namespaces with 5000 and 6000 series NICs


Docker Containers
-----------------

This release of OpenOnload includes support for multiple network
namespaces and Docker containers using the Docker MACVLAN network
driver.

In brief, this release supports Docker configurations where a MACVLAN
interface is used to give the container direct access to the
appropriate Solarflare NIC.  Onload will not accelerate other types of
network interface, including software bridged or overlay networks.
Onload will only currently accelerate traffic between the container
and the NIC; any traffic between containers on the same host will not
be accelerated by Onload.

The version of Onload installed in the container image must match that
running in the host.

This functionality currently requires 8000-series adapters.

During testing we have focused on Docker 1.12 as packaged in RHEL7.

Please see the Onload user guide for details of how to use Onload with
Docker.


Bonding
-------

In older versions of Onload knowledge of the current bonding
configuration was obtained by polling the state exposed by the kernel
in /proc and /sys.  The frequency of polling was configured using the
"oo_bond_poll_base" and "oo_bond_poll_peak" module parameters.  This
took a value in jiffies - the kernel unit of time measurement.

In this version of Onload knowledge of the current bonding
configuration is where possible obtained by netlink.  I.e. periodic
polling of /proc and /sys is no longer necessary, and the
oo_bond_poll_base/peak parameters are not required. However on some
older supported OSes (e.g. SLES11) netlink does not provide the
necessary information and so periodic polling is still used.

As part of the change outlined above to introduce the control plane
server process, these values are now configured through the
--bond_base_period and --bond_peak_period arguments to
onload_cp_server.  Their values are in milliseconds rather than
jiffies.  The arguments used to launch onload_cp_server can in turn be
configured using the cplane_server_params onload module parameter.

When LACP aggregation is in use, Onload ignores the transmit hash mode
(and uses Layer3+4) in following cases:
- the aggregation is set up via team module (as in previous releases);
- the aggregation is set up via bond module, but Linux kernel is older than
  3.14. (NB. RHEL6, RHEL7, and SLES12 all have the new kernel
  behaviour backported, and so use the configured hash mode)


Interface blacklisting and whitelisting
---------------------------------------

The implementation of Onload's black-list and white-list of interfaces
to use for acceleration has been reworked in this release.  These are
now a property of a stack, rather than global lists, and are
configured using new environment variables EF_INTERFACE_WHITELIST and
EF_INTERFACE_BLACKLIST.  Please see the Onload user guide for details.
Any systems attempting to configure these lists using the old method
for configuration (module options, /proc) will fail and this may cause
modules to refuse to load due to unknown module options.


Policy routing
--------------

This release adds support for policy routing for unicast packets, if
policy rules are based on source or destination IP, TOS, and/or
outgoing interface (with SO_BINDTODEVICE).

Policy rules based on fwmarks are ignored by Onload. If a socket is
bound to an address, and the address is removed, then in certain
circumstances Onload can continue to use this address for sending.

Due to this addition, the previous EF_TCP_LISTEN_REPLIES_BACK option
has been removed, as source routing effectively replaces it.


MACVLAN interfaces
------------------

This release includes support for MACVLAN interfaces, both with containers
(see above) and in standard setups.  These will be accelerated when they are
created over a Solarflare NIC.  If additional functions are in use then due to
filtering limitations in the NIC either the NIC needs to be configured to use
the "low-latency" firmware variant, or if using the "full-featured" firmware
variant insecure_filters=1 sfboot option needs to be specified.  If the sfboot
tool reports "Physical Functions on this port 1" and "Virtual Functions on
each PF 0" then this restriction does not apply.

Although there are no specific firmware dependencies we recommend using the
most recent GA firmware version available.

We do not support multiple layers of MACVLAN, e.g. where one MACVLAN
is created with another MACVLAN interface as its parent.  In addition,
TCPDirect does not supported multiple layers of VLAN + MACVLAN
interfaces.


IP_PKTINFO
----------

The IP_PKTINFO socket option may provide incorrect information for
incoming multicast packets when there are multiple MACVLAN interfaces
in the same net namespace, or basic and macvlan interface in the same
net namespace, as it can't distinguish which interface was used by
that packet.


MRG 2.0 load issue
------------------

An issue found during testing for this release affects driver load on
MRG 2.0 systems.  The build succeeds but driver load will fail with
the error "onload: Unknown symbol __put_task_struct".  If you are
using MRG 2.0 a fix for this is available from support@solarflare.com


VLAN-over-VLAN interfaces
-------------------------

An issue found during testing for this release shows that interfaces
where one VLAN interface is layered over the top of another VLAN
interface are not properly accelerated by Onload.  If you need to use
these interfaces with an Onload-accelerated application please contact
support@solarflare.com for a fix.


Other new EF_ options
---------------------

In addition to those mentioned above, the following new EF_* options
have been added.  Please see the Onload user guide for details.

EF_TCP_TSOPT_MODE - enable or disable TCP header timestamps 

EF_CLUSTER_HOT_RESTART - enable seamless restart of applications using
SO_REUSEPORT


Other Additions
---------------

* Proprietary binary kernel module present in recent releases is
  removed, so no kernel taint anymore
* Debug (lockdep, etc) kernels now work again.
