OpenOnload-201811-u1
====================

 This is a minor update to refresh the sfc net driver included in
 the Onload package and to provide fixes to various bugs found in
 openonload-201811.

 See the accompanying ChangeLog for a list of bugs fixed.


Linux distribution support
--------------------------

 This package is supported on:
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.8 - 6.10
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 - 7.6
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0
 - SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 sp3 and sp4
 - SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 and sp1
 - Canonical Ubuntu Server LTS 18.04
 - Canonical Ubuntu Server 19.04
 - Debian 8 "Jessie"
 - Debian 9 "Stretch"
 - Linux kernels 3.0 - 5.0


Running control plane server as non-root user
---------------------------------------------

The control plane server now optionally drops privileges. This can be configured
using the ONLOAD_CPLANE_USER setting in /etc/sysconfig/openonload, or by passing
the cplane_server_uid and cplane_server_gid parameters to the onload module. The
server retains CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.

This also means that the server depends on libcap library.


Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0
----------------------------

Users of RHEL 8 will need to ensure that the new Codeready-Builder
repository is included in their system's repository list to provide
the libpcap-devel build dependency.

Onload Docker support has not been qualified for RHEL 8.0 in this release.


OpenOnload-201811
=================

 This is a feature release that adds new features to TCPDirect,
 extends architecture, NIC and OS support, provides improvements
 to Onload's performance in lossy network environments and includes
 many bug fixes.

 Preview-level support is provided for ARM's 64-bit architecture and
 support for AMD CPUs prior to the Zen architecture is deprecated.

 The notes below describe some of the new features. See the Onload
 user guide for full details of new features and associated
 configuration options.

 See the accompanying ChangeLog for a list of bugs fixed.


Linux distribution support
--------------------------

 This package is supported on:
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 - 6.10
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 - 7.6
 - SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 sp3 and sp4*
 - SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 15
 - Canonical Ubuntu Server LTS 18.04
 - Canonical Ubuntu Server 18.10
 - Debian 8 "Jessie"
 - Debian 9 "Stretch"
 - Linux kernels 3.0 - 4.19

* SLES 12 sp4 was only available in pre-release form at the time this
  OpenOnload release was tested.


TCPDirect bonding
-----------------

 This release enables TCPDirect to send and receive traffic over a bonded
 interface. Bonded interfaces can now be specified using the interface
 attribute, as with regular interfaces. See the user guide for further
 details.

 The following bonding modes are supported:
 - Active-backup
 - LACP with layer2, layer2+3 and layer3+4 transmit hash policies

 TCPDirect bonding has the following constraints:
 - Bonded interfaces of up to 4 Solarflare network adapters are supported.
 - Failover is supported, however bonds may not be otherwise reconfigured
   while TCPDirect is running.
 - TX Alternatives must be disabled in stacks using bonding.
 - All interfaces in the bond must be in the same network namespace.
 - VLAN, IPVLAN and MACVLAN interfaces created over a bond are not supported.
 - As with Onload, bonding of VLAN, IPVLAN and MACVLAN interfaces is not
   supported.


TCPDirect transmit timestamping
-------------------------------

 Transmit timestamping support was added to TCPDirect and can be enabled by
 specifying tx_timestamping attribute. Transmit timestamps can be retrieved
 by calling zft_get_tx_timestamps for TCP and zfut_get_tx_timestamps for UDP
 zockets. Please see the TCPDirect user guide and zftcppingpong/zfudppingpong
 sample applications for more details.


Onload TCP performance in lossy network environments
----------------------------------------------------

 This release makes several improvements to Onload's TCP core in the presence
 of loss and reordering, as can be the case, for example, where the route to
 the peer traverses the internet.

 - EF_TAIL_DROP_PROBE

   Classical TCP implementations recover poorly from the case where the last
   segment(s) in flight are dropped. This results in no visible gap in
   sequence space, and so there is nothing to trigger fast retransmissions;
   instead, the segments are retransmitted by the RTO mechanism. In order to
   attempt to trigger a fast retransmission in the case where such tail-loss is
   suspected, a "tail-drop probe" segment can be sent after a short timeout.
   This segment would either be the next segment due to be transmitted, or an
   opportunistic retransmission of the most recent in-flight segment.

   Previous releases of Onload had a tail-drop probe implementation, but it was
   not compiled in by default. In this release, the mechanism has been
   rewritten, and is now built by default. Its use is controlled at runtime by
   the EF_TAIL_DROP_PROBE environment variable, which previously defaulted to 0
   (off) but now defaults to the value read from the kernel configuration at
   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_early_retrans, which defaults to on.

 - EF_TCP_EARLY_RETRANSMIT

   This release implements the Early Retransmit (RFC 5827) algorithm for TCP,
   and also the Limited Transmit (RFC 3042) algorithm, on which Early
   Retransmit depends. As for tail-drop probes, the purpose of these algorithms
   is to allow fast retransmissions to happen more readily. The use of these
   algorithms is controlled by the EF_TCP_EARLY_RETRANSMIT environment
   variable, whose default value is read from the kernel configuration at
   /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_early_retrans.

 - SACK improvements

   Selective acknowledgments received from the peer are now used to grow the
   congestion window more aggressively when recovering from loss.


Onload initial sequence number caching
--------------------------------------

Applications which rapidly open and close a large number of connections to
other machines may experience occasional connection failures due to the rapid
reuse of TCP sequence numbers being detected as retransmits in the TIME-WAIT
state. This is most commonly a problem with Windows and FreeBSD TCP stacks.

The standard RFC-derived algorithm for avoiding this problem relies on a
clock ticking at a rate which is faster than bytes are transmitted. A link
running at 100Mb can theoretically transmit faster than the clock can tick,
however, and 10Gb+ links can practically do this.

Onload has added the EF_TCP_ISN_MODE option to provide a solution. The
default "clocked" setting uses the standard best-effort algorithm. The
"clocked+cache" setting will store the last sequence number used for every
remote endpoint to guarantee that the problem is avoided. This mode is
recommended for applications such as proxies which rapidly open and close
connections to a variety of unknown, third-party servers.

The following settings may be used to fine-tune the clocked+cache mode:

 - EF_TCP_ISN_CACHE_SIZE
   Number of entries to allocate in the cache of remote endpoints. The default
   value of 0 selects a size automatically.

 - EF_TCP_ISN_INCLUDE_PASSIVE
   Store data for closed passively-opened connections in the cache. This data
   would only be needed by an application which closed its listening socket
   and continued to run, so the option is disabled by default

 - EF_TCP_ISN_OFFSET
   Distance by which to step the initial sequence number of new connections
   relative to the previous connection. Only extremely specialized
   applications would consider changing the default.

 - EF_TCP_ISN_2MSL
   Maximum amount of time that any remote TCP stack's implementation will
   leave a socket in the TIME-WAIT state. This is configurable in many
   systems, however the default value of 240 seconds is a maximum common value
   across a variety of operating systems.


Other Onload configuration options changes
------------------------------------------

In addition to those already mentioned, this release of Onload
adds or modifies the following environmental options:

 - EF_TCP_URG_MODE
   New option to allow disabling TCP urgent data processing. Urgent data is
   a rarely-used feature which is inconsistently implemented on various
   operating systems, however applications which are written to the Linux
   convention will experience corrupt data if they use the "ignore" setting
   and actually receive urgent data.

 - EF_TCP_TIME_WAIT_ASSASSINATION
   New option to implement the RFC 1337 behaviour of replacing old TIME-WAIT
   sockets with newly-received incoming connections. The default value is
   read from /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rfc1337.

 - EF_TCP_SHARED_LOCAL_PORTS_PER_IP_MAX
   New option to fine-tune the shared local ports feature. Sets the maximum
   size of the pool of local shared ports for given local IP address. When
   used with scalable RSS mode this setting limits the total number within the
   cluster.

 - EF_TCP_SHARED_LOCAL_PORTS_STEP
   New option to fine-tune the shared local ports feature. Controls the number
   of ports allocated when expanding the pool of shared local ports.


TCPDirect errors issued by newer C++ compilers
----------------------------------------------

Applications using TCPDirect may fail to build with g++ version 6 and above
with the message "error: flexible array member 'zft_msg::iov' not at end of
'struct my_msg'". To work around this issue, application code may be modified
from

struct my_msg {
  zft_msg msg;
  iovec iov[1];
};

to

typedef struct {
  zft_msg msg;
  iovec iov[1];
} my_msg;
