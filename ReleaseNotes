OpenOnload-201606 Release Notes
===============================

This is a major update release that adds new features to OpenOnload.

Below is a brief summary of the new features and any limitations that we are
aware of.  See the ChangeLog for further details and a list of bugs fixed.


Linux distribution support

This Onload package is supported on:
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.10 - 5.11
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.6 - 6.8
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 - 7.2
- Red Hat Messaging Realtime and Grid 2.4, 2.5

- SuSE Linux Enterprise Realtime Extension 11
- SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 base and sp1
- Canonical Ubuntu Server LTS 14.04

- Linux kernels 2.6.32 - 4.6


Solarflare Flareon Ultra 8500 NICs
----------------------------------

This release adds full support for the new range of Solarflare Flareon
Ultra 8500-series NICs.  If you are interested in learning more about
the improved performance and features available please contact
sales@solarflare.com


New configuration options
-------------------------

EF_TCP_LISTEN_REPLIES_BACK: When a TCP listening socket replies to an
incoming SYN, this option forces Onload to ignore the route table and
to reply on the same network interface the SYN was received from.
This mode could be considered as a way to achieve some basic
source-based routing

EF_HIGH_THROUGHPUT_MODE: This option causes onload to optimise the
stack and VI configuration for throughput at the cost of latency

In addition, some of the control-plane module options have been moved
or renamed - please the control plane section below for details.


ef_vi Transmit Alternatives API
-------------------------------

This release adds a new method for sending data to the ef_vi API.
Using the ef_vi_transmit_alt* functions a set of alternative packets
can be queued in the NIC ready to be sent.  Once the decision about
which alternative to send is made the correct one is released onto
the network with extremely low latency.

Please refer to the ef_vi documentation for further details.  This is
supported on 8000-series NICs and later.


ef_vi Capabilities API
----------------------

This release adds support for an ef_vi API that will allow users to
query at runtime what features and capabilities are available on the
hardware as it is currently configured.  This allows applications to
built once, then run on a variety of Solarflare NICs and tailor the
feature set they use to the current hardware capabilities.

Please see src/include/etherfabric/capabilites.h for the API
documentation and details of the features that can currently be queried.


IPv6 ef_vi filtering
--------------------

This release adds support for IPv6 filters in ef_vi.  Please see the
documentation for ef_filter_spec_set_ip6_local() and
ef_filter_spec_set_ip6_full() for further details.  This is supported
on 7000-series NICs and later.


onload_thread_get_spin extension API
------------------------------------

This release adds a new extensions API call to query per-thread spin
settings, to complement the existing onload_thread_set_spin().
onload_thread_get_spin() retrieves the spin settings previously
configured via onload_thread_set_spin().

Please refer to src/include/onload/extensions.h for the API documentation.


Teamd support for mixed bonds
-----------------------------

OpenOnload-201509 added support for bonds configured using teamd in
addition to the long-standing bonding module.  It has recently become
apparent that Onload is not correctly dealing with teamd-configured
bonds that have a mix of Solarflare and non-Solarflare interfaces.
Onload should recognise these as unacceleratable but currently will
attempt to accelerate traffic on the Solarflare interfaces in the
bond, which may lead to unexpected behaviour should the bond failover
to a non-Solarflare interface.

We will address this in a future update release.  To work around the
problem we recommend using the bonding module to configure bonds that
have a mix of Solarflare and non-Solarflare interfaces in them.


sfc_resource /proc file name change
-----------------------------------

To avoid a naming collision when interfaces are renamed the files that
used to be at /proc/driver/sfc_resource/ethX/pdY have moved to
/proc/driver/sfc_resource/devices/0000:0Z.00.0/pdY


New onload_cplane module
------------------------

This release of Onload adds a new binary module named onload_cplane.
This new module provides some of the module parameters that used to be
handled by other solarflare modules:
- oo_bond_poll_base 
- oo_igmp_on_failover 
- max_layer2_interfaces 
- max_routes
- max_neighs 
- oo_teaming_dump_period
- oo_teaming_listen_updates

In previous versions max_layer2_interfaces was used to limit the size
of both the llap table (table of IP interfaces) and ipif table (table
of IP addresses).  This has now been separated and max_local_addrs has
been added to control the size of the ipif table.

The onload_cplane module also takes a new parameter cplane_debug_bits,
similar to the existing oo_debug_bits parameter, to control the level
of debug logging produced.

A number of /proc files have been changed:
- All /proc/driver/onload/mib-* have moved to
 /proc/driver/onload_cplane/mib-*; the files themselves are exactly the
 same as previously, apart from /proc/driver/onload/mib-hwport which 
 has been removed.
- /proc/driver/onload/cplane has been renamed to
 /proc/driver/onload_cplane/stats.
- /proc/driver/onload_cplane/version is a new file containing version
 information of the onload_cplane module.

Some build-time configuration options have been effectively removed as
they are set at build time of the onload_cplane module:
- CI_CFG_MAX_REGISTER_INTERFACES
- CI_CFG_TEAMING

Finally, some Linux kernel versions break the API symbols used by
Onload and users should upgrade to a later release where these kernel
bugs have been fixed:
- 4.2.0 and 4.2.1: please use 4.2.2 or later
- 3.7.x and 3.8.x: please use 3.7.10 or >=3.9
- 3.0.9-rt* from MRG2.1: please use later MRG kernel


sfc_aoe module
--------------

The sfc_aoe module is no longer included in the Onload distribution.
This will in future be distributed separately to allow independent
releases of these two products. If this causes issues please contact
support@solarflare.com 


Interrupt-driven event burst
----------------------------

During testing for this release we have encountered a rare issue when
running Onload in interrupt-driven mode with multiple threads or
processes sharing a stack and using both ports of a NIC at high
traffic rates.  In this situation Onload can cause the NIC to generate
a large burst of events which in turn will overflow the net driver's
event queue.  Due to the timings involved this mainly affects the new
8500 series NICs, but can in theory apply to earlier generations of
hardware.  It is not a new issue, so if you have not experienced this
on previous Onload releases there is no additional risk in upgrading
to this release.  The symptoms include warnings from the kernel driver
about driverlink handle_event() operations taking a long time and MCDI
requests completing without an event.  This may cause the driver to
reset the NIC in an attempt to recover.  Solarflare have a fix to
resolve this that is currently being tested and will be included in an
update release.
