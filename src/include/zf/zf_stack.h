**
** A stack encapsulates hardware and protocol state.  A stack binds to a single
** network interface, specified by the `interface` attribute in @p attr.  To
** process events on a stack, call zf_reactor_perform() or zf_muxer_wait().
**
** Relevant attributes to set in @p attr are those in the `zf_stack`,
** `zf_pool` and `zf_vi` categories described in the attributes documentation
** in \ref attributes.
**
** \return 0 on success, or a negative error code:
** \return -EBUSY   Out of VI instances or resources for alternatives.
** \return -EINVAL  Attribute out of range.
** \return -ENODEV  Interface was not specified or was invalid.
** \return -ENOENT  Failed to initialize ef_vi or Onload libraries.  A likely
**                  cause is that Onload drivers are not loaded.
** \return -ENOKEY  Adapter is not licensed for TCPDirect.
** \return -ENOMEM  Out of memory.  N.B. Huge pages are required.
** \return -ENOSPC  Out of PIO buffers.
** \return Errors from system calls are also possible.  Please consult your
** system's documentation for `errno(3)`.

/**
 * \brief Returns a boolean value indicating whether a stack is quiescent.
 *
 * A stack is quiescent precisely when all of the following are true:
 *   - the stack will not transmit any packets except in response to external
 *     stimuli (including relevant API calls),
 *   - closing zockets will not result in the transmission of any packets, and
 *   - (optionally, controlled by the \c tcp_wait_for_time_wait stack
 *     attribute) there are no TCP zockets in the TIME_WAIT state.
 * In practice, this is equivalent altogether to the condition that there are
 * no open TCP connections.
 *
 * This can be used to ensure that all connections have been closed gracefully
 * before destroying a stack (or exiting the application).  Destroying a stack
 * while it is not quiescent is permitted by the API, but when doing so there
 * is no guarantee that sent data has been acknowledged by the peer or even
 * transmitted, and there is the possibility that peers' connections will be
 * reset.
 *
 * \sa zf_stack_to_waitable()
 *
 * \returns Non-zero if the stack is quiescent, or zero otherwise.
