** \brief The multiplexer, which allows multiple objects to be polled in
**        a single operation.
**
** The multiplexer allows multiple zockets to be polled in a single
** operation.  The basic unit of functionality is the <i>multiplexer set</i>
** implemented by #zf_muxer_set.  Each type of zocket that can be multiplexed
** is equipped with a method for obtaining a #zf_waitable that represents a
** given zocket; this #zf_waitable can then be added to a multiplexer set by
** calling zf_muxer_add().  Having added all of the desired zockets to a set,
** the set can be polled using zf_muxer_wait().
**
** The multiplexer owes much of its design (and some of its datatypes) to
** <tt>epoll(7)</tt>.

** This function polls a multiplexer set and populates an array of event
** descriptors representing the waitables in that set that are ready.  The
** `events` member of each descriptor specifies the events for which the
** waitable is actually ready, and the `data` member is set to the user-data
** associated with that descriptor, as specified in the call to zf_muxer_add()
** or zf_muxer_mod().
**
** Before checking for ready objects, the function calls zf_reactor_perform()
** on the set's stack in order to process events from the hardware.  In
** contrast to the rest of the API, zf_muxer_wait() can block.  The maximum
** time to block is specified by @p timeout_ns, and a value of zero results in
** non-blocking behaviour.  A negative value for @p timeout_ns will allow the
** function to block indefinitely.  If the function, blocks, it will call
** zf_reactor_perform() repeatedly in a tight loop.
**
** The multiplexer supports only edge-triggered events: that is, if
** zf_muxer_wait() reports that a waitable is ready, it need not do so again
** until a <i>new</i> event occurs on tha waitable, even if the waitable is
** in fact ready.  On the other hand, a waitable <i>may</i> be reported as
** ready even when a new event has not occurred, but only when the waitable is
** in fact ready.  A transition from "not ready" to "ready" always constitutes
** an edge, and in particular, for `EPOLLIN`, the arrival of any new data
** constitutes an edge.

 * expired, or a connection has changed state.  When this occurs the
 * caller should ensure they call zf_muxer_wait() to allow the
 * required activity to take place, and discover if this affected any
 * of the stack's zockets that the caller is interested in.  This may
 * or may not result in a zocket within the stack becoming readable or
