**
** \return -EBUSY     Unable to queue due to a transient problem, e.g. the
**                    alternative queue is still draining from a
**                    previous operation. These errors are expected to
**                    clear quickly without outside intervention; the

**                    window.

** \return -ENOMEM    Unable to queue due to all packet buffers being
**                    allocated already.
**
** \return -ENOBUFS   Unable to queue due to a lack of available buffer 
**                    space, either in TCP Direct or in the NIC hardware.
**
** \return -EINVAL    Invalid parameters.  This includes the case where the
**                    alternative already has data queued on another zocket.
**
** This function behaves similarly to zft_send(), but doesn't actually put
** the data on the wire.
**
** For now it is only possible to send a single buffer of data in each
** call to zft_alternatives_queue(); this function will return -EINVAL
** if 'iov_cnt' is not equal to 1. Future releases may change this.
** Multiple messages can be queued for sending on a single alternative
** by calling zft_alternatives_queue() for each message.
**
** The current implementation limits all messages enqueued on an
** alternative to be from the same zocket.  This may change in future.
**
** In some cases where an alternative is in the middle of an operation
** such as a send, cancel, etc. this function may return -EBUSY. In
** this case the caller should process some events and retry.
