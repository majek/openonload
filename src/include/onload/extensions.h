/* Use ONLOAD_MSG_WARM in the flags field of send(), sendto(), sendmsg(),

 *
 * This is advantageous because code paths that have not run recently
 * execute slowly.  ie. A send() call will take much longer if the previous
 * send was 1s ago than if it was 1ms ago, and the reason is because cached
 * state in the processor is lost over time.  This flag exercises Onload's
 * send path so that a subsequent performance critical send() will be
 * faster.
 *
 * WARNING!!! Note that if you use this flag with unaccelerated sockets,
 * then the message may actually be transmitted.  Therefore, we recommend
 * that before using this flag on a socket, you verify that the socket is
 * indeed accelerated by using onload_fd_stat() or onload_fd_check_feature()
 * You should check this for each socket, after you call bind() or connect()
 * on it; as these functions can cause the socket to be handed to the kernel.

 * onload_delegated_send: send via EF_VI to the Onload-managed TCP connection
 *
 * onload_delegated_send_prepare: prepare to send up to "size" bytes.
 * Allocates "headers" and fill them in with Ethernet-IP-TCP header data.
 * Returns:
 * ONLOAD_DELEGATED_SEND_RC_OK=0 in case of success;
 * ONLOAD_DELEGATED_SEND_RC_BAD_SOCKET: invalid socket
 *     (non-Onloaded, non-TCP, non-connected or write-shutdowned);
 * ONLOAD_DELEGATED_SEND_RC_SMALL_HEADER: too small headers_len value
 *     (headers_len is set to the correct size);
 * ONLOAD_DELEGATED_SEND_RC_SENDQ_BUSY: send queue is not empty;
 * ONLOAD_DELEGATED_SEND_RC_NOARP: failed to find the destination MAC
 *      address;
 * ONLOAD_DELEGATED_SEND_RC_NOWIN: send window or congestion window
 *      is closed.  send_wnd and cong_wnd fields are filled in,
 *      so the caller can find out which window is closed.
 *
 * ARP resolution in onload_delegated_send_prepare():
 * default (flags=0):
 *   Ask kernel for ARP information if necessary;
 *   fail if such information is not available.
 *   It is recommended to use a normal send() for the first part of the
 *   data if onload_delegated_send_prepare() returns
 *   ONLOAD_DELEGATED_SEND_RC_NOARP.
 * flags=ONLOAD_DELEGATED_SEND_FLAG_IGNORE_ARP:
 *   Do not look for correct ARP.  The caller will fill in
 *   the destination MAC address.
 * flags=ONLOAD_DELEGATED_SEND_FLAG_RESOLVE_ARP:
 *   If ARP information is not available, send a speculative TCP ACK
 *   to provoke kernel into ARP resolution.  Wait up to 1ms for ARP
 *   information to appear.
 * 
 *
 * onload_delegated_send_prepare() can be called speculatively.
 *
 *
 * onload_delegated_send_tcp_update: update packet headers with data length
 * and push flag details.
 * TCP PUSH flag: The flag is expected to be set on the last packet when
 * sending a large data chunk.  In the most cases, contemporary OSes ignore
 * TCP PUSH flag on receive.  However, you probably want to set it
 * correcctly if your TCP stream is received by an older OS.
 * Length: onload_delegated_send_prepare() assumes that the packet length
 * is equal to mss.  If it is a correct assumption, there is no need to
 * call onload_delegated_send_tcp_update().
 *
 *
 * onload_delegated_send_tcp_advance: advance headers after sending
 * one TCP packet via EF_VI.
 *
 *
 * onload_delegated_send_complete: tell this TCP connection that
 * some data was sent via EF_VI.  This function can be thought as send() or
 * sendmsg() replacement.
 * Most of the flags are ignored, except: MSG_DONTWAIT, MSG_NOSIGNAL.
 *
 * If the call is successful, Onload takes care about any further issues
 * with the data: retransmit in case of packet loss, PMTU changes, etc.
 * This function can block because of SO_SNDBUF limitation.  When blocked,
 * the function call can be interrupted by signal and return the number of
 * bytes already processed (added to retransmit queue).
 * This function ignores SO_SNDTIMEO value.
 * You can pass your data to onload via multiple _complete() calls after
 * one _prepare() call.
 *
 *
 * onload_delegated_send_cancel: No more delegated send is planned.
 * Normal send(), shutdown() or close() can be called after this call.
 * This call is necessary if you need to close the connection graciously
 * when the file descriptor is closed via close() or exit().
 * 
 * There is no need to call _cancel() before _prepare().  There is no
 * need to call _cancel if all the bytes specified in _prepare were
 * sent. If some (but not all) of the bytes specified in _prepare were
 * sent, you must call _complete() for the sent bytes and _cancel()
 * for the remaining reserved-but-not-sent bytes.  This is true even
 * if the reason for not sending is that you've reached the window
 * limits retured by the _prepare() call.
 *
 *
 * Note 1, serialization.
 * User is responsible for serialization of onload_delegated_send_*()
 * calls.  I.e. user should call onload_delegated_send_prepare() first,
 * and onload_delegated_send_cancel() later.  Normal send(), write(),
 * sendfile() function MUST NOT be called in between or in parallel with
 * these calls.  Misbehaving applications might crash.
 *
 *
 * Note 2, latency/performance.
 * If you need the best latency in the worst case, you must call
 * _complete() as soon as possible.  If you are using EF_VI to send the
 * real packets, do not wait for TX complete events - call _complete() at
 * once.  It will allow TCP machinery to retransmit packet if any of them
 * are lost.
 * If you want to save some CPU cycles at cost of making TCP retransmits
 * a bit slower (i.e. at the cost of worse latency in case of packet loss):
 * call _complete() later, to allow the network peer to acknowledge your data.
 * With the late _complete() call, you'll avoid copying of your data into TCP
 * retransmit queue (if there are no packet loss).
 *
 *
 * Sample code0: Try to send via delegated sends API and if not enough space
   fall back to normal send.
