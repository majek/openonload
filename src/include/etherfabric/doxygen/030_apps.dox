/*! \page applications Example Applications

Solarflare %ef_vi comes with a range of example applications - including
source code and make files. This is a quick guide to using them, both for
testing %ef_vi's effectiveness in an environment, and as starting points
for developing applications.

Not all of these applications are available in the current Onload
release; but source code is available on request.

Most of these applications have additional options to test physical
addressing mode, or hardware timestamping. Run with "--help" to check this.

\section eflatency eflatency

The eflatency application echoes a single packet back and forth 
repeatedly, measuring the round-trip time.

This is the most useful example application for testing lowest possible 
latency. It is not a very good sample for building an application, because:
- it uses only one filter
- it operates knowing that there is only ever a single packet on the wire,
  and so:
  - does not need to refill the rings
  - does not handle multiple event types.

\subsection eflatency_usage Usage

__Server:__ <code>eflatency pong _interface_</code>

__Client:__ <code>eflatency ping _interface_</code>

where:
- _interface_ is the multicast interface on the server or client machine
  (e.g. `eth0`)

There are various additional options. See the help text for details.

\section efsend efsend

The efsend application sends UDP packets on a specified interface.

The application sends a UDP packet, waits for transmission of the
packet to finish and then sends the next.

The number of packets sent, the size of the packet, the amount of
time to wait between sends can be controlled.

\section efsink efsink

The efsink application is a demonstration of capturing packets, and the 
flexibility of filters.

It supports all filter types that %ef_vi supports. By default it just 
reports the amount of data captured, but it also demonstrates simple 
actions upon the packet data, with the option to hexdump incoming packets.

It is a very useful jumping off point as it shows:
- creation of a virtual interface
- creation and installation of filters
- polling the event queue.

However, it does not cover sending packets.

\section efforward efforward

The efforward application listens for traffic on one interface and echoes 
it out of a second; and vice versa. It demonstrates a very simple 
high-performance bridge.

Some route configuration on the clients might be necessary to get this 
working, but it is a very simple example, and is very easy to start adding 
packet re-writing rules etc.

Although this is a viable starting point for a bridging application, a 
better option might be the SolarCapture API, which includes a more 
complete pre-made bridging application.

\section efsend_timestamping efsend_timestamping

The efsend_timestamping application sends UDP packets on a specified interface.

The application sends a UDP packet, waits for transmission of the
packet to finish and then sends the next.

This application requests tx timestamping, allowing it to report the time
each packet was transmitted.

The number of packets sent, the size of the packet, the amount of
time to wait between sends can be controlled.

\section efsend_pio efsend_pio

The efsend_pio application that sends UDP packets on a specified interface.

Packet data is copied to the NIC's PIO buffer before being sent,
which typically results in lower latency sends compared to accessing
packet data stored on the host via DMA, which is the method used by
the efsend sample app.

The application sends a UDP packet, waits for transmission of the
packet to finish and then sends the next.

The number of packets sent, the size of the packet, the amount of
time to wait between sends can be controlled.

\section efsink_packed efsink_packed

The efsink_packed application is a variant of \ref efsink that 
demonstrates usage of the packed-stream firmware.

\section efforward_packed efforward_packed

The efforward_packed application is a variant of \ref efforward that 
demonstrates usage of the packed-stream firmware.

\section efrss efrss

The efrss application is a variant of \ref efforward. It demonstrates 
automatically spreading the load over multiple threads, using a vi_set and 
RSS.

\section efdelegated_client efdelegated_client

The efdelegated_client application demonstrates usage of OpenOnload's
"Delegated Sends" feature.  This API allows you to do delegate TCP sends
for a particular socket to some other mechanism.  For example, this
sample uses the ef_vi layer-2 API in order to get lower latency than is
possible with a normal send() call.

The API essentially boils down to first retriving the packet headers,
adding your own payload to form a raw packet, sending the packet and
finally telling Onload what it was you sent so it can update the
internal TCP state of the socket.

This sample application allows you to compare the performance of normal
sends using the kernel stack, using OpenOnload and using ef_vi with the
delegated sends API.  It establishes a TCP connection to the server
process, which starts sending UDP multicast messages.  The client
receives these messages, and replies to a subset of them with a TCP
message.  The server measures the latency from the UDP send to the TCP
receive.

\subsection efdelegated_client_usage Usage

For normal socket-based sends, run as follows:

__Server:__ <code>onload -p latency ./efdelegated_server _mcast-intf_</code>
__Client:__ <code>onload -p latency ./efdelegated_client _mcast-intf_ _server_</code>

For "delegated" sends, run as follows:

__Server:__ <code>onload -p latency ./efdelegated_server _mcast-intf_</code>
__Client:__ <code>onload -p latency ./efdelegated_client -d _mcast-intf_ _server_</code>

where:
- _mcast-intf_ is the multicast interface on the server or client machine
  (e.g. `eth0`)
- _server_ is the IP address of the server machine (e.g. `192.168.0.10`)

There are various additional options. See the help text for details.

\section efdelegated_server efdelegated_server

The efdelegated_server application is used together with efdelegated_client
to measure the performance of OpenOnload's "Delegated Sends" feature.

This application is a very basic simulation of an exchange: It accepts a
TCP connection from a client.  It sends UDP multicast messages, and
expects that the client will send a message over the TCP connection in
response to a subset of the UDP messages.  It measures the time taken
from sending a UDP message to receiving the corresponding reply.

When used with OpenOnload this application uses hardware timestamps
taken on the adapter so that the latency measured is very accurate.
(Note that for 7000-series adapters this requires a Performance Monitor
license).

\subsection efdelegated_server_usage Usage

See \ref efdelegated_client_usage for \ref efdelegated_client.
 
\section building Building the Example Applications

The %ef_vi example applications are built along with the Onload 
installation and will be present in the 
`/Onload-&lt;version>/build/gnu_x86_64/tests/ef_vi` subdirectory.  In the 
  build directory there will be `gnu`, `gnu_x86_64`, 
  `x86_64_linux-&lt;kernel version>` directories:
- files under the `gnu` directory are 32-bit (if these are built)
- files under the `gnu_x86_64` directory are 64-bit.

Source code files for the example applications exist in the 
`/Onload-&lt;version>/src/tests/ef_vi` subdirectory.

To rebuild the example applications you must have the 
`Onload-&lt;version>/scripts` subdirectory in your path and use the 
following procedure:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
[root@server01 Onload-201109]# cd scripts/
[root@server01 scripts]# export PATH="$PWD:$PATH"
[root@server01 scripts]# mmakebuildtree        And select for example gnu_x86_64
[root@server01 scripts]# cd ../build/gnu_x86_64/tests/ef_vi/
[root@server01 ef_vi]# make clean
[root@serverr01 ef_vi]# make ONLOAD_ONLY=1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
