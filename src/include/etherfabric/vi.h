**
** Allocate a set of TX alternatives for use with a virtual interface. The
** virtual interface must have been allocated with the EF_VI_TX_ALT flag.
**
** The space remains allocated until the virtual interface is freed.
**
** TX alternatives provide a mechanism to send with very low latency.  They
** work by pre-loading packets into the adapter in advance, and then
** calling ef_vi_transmit_alt_go() to transmit the packets.
**
** Packets are pre-loaded into the adapter using normal send calls such as
** ef_vi_transmit().  Use ef_vi_transmit_alt_select() to select which
** "alternative" to load the packet into.
**
** Each alternative has three states: STOP, GO and DISCARD.  The
** ef_vi_transmit_alt_stop(), ef_vi_transmit_alt_go() and
** ef_vi_transmit_alt_discard() calls transition between the states.
** Typically an alternative is placed in the STOP state, selected,
** pre-loaded with one or more packets, and then later on the critical path
** placed in the GO state.
**
** When packets are transmitted via TX alternatives, events of type
** EF_EVENT_TYPE_TX_ALT are returned to the application.  The application
** is responsible for ensuring that all of the packets in an alternative
** have been sent before transitioning from GO or DISCARD to the STOP
** state.
**
** The @p buf_space parameter gives the amount of buffering to allocate for
** this set of TX alternatives, in bytes.  Note that if this buffering is
** exceeded then packets sent to TX alternatives may be truncated or
** dropped, and no error is reported in this case.
