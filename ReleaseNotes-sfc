NIC partitioning, SR-IOV and PF-IOV modes on SFN7XXX adapters
-------------------------------------------------------------
This release of the Solarflare Linux Net driver supports NIC partitioning
(multiple PFs) and SR-IOV (VFs).

See "Solarflare Server Adapter User's Guide" SF-103837-CD Issue >=12
available from https://support.solarflare.com for more detailed information
on setting up NIC partitioning, SR-IOV or PF-IOV modes.

Some additional details as well as known issues are documented below:
General:
  ~ NIC partitioning/SRIOV/PF-IOV features require sfutils >=v4.3.0.1010 which
    contains adapter firmware v4.2.1.1014 and firmware-variant=full-feature
    (setup with sfboot)
  ~ Please note that Hybrid SR-IOV support for SFN5XXX|6XXX drivers is now
    deprecated. Please use an older driver to continue using this feature.
  ~ Link control (e.g. setting pause frames with ethtool and controlling MTU) is
    only available on the first PF on each port; (this is referred to as "PF0"
    or the "primary PF")
  ~ Only link control functions have the full MAC statistics available to them
    (via ethtool -S). All statistics that come from the MAC are now prefixed
    "port_" as they refer to a single physical network port.
    All other functions have statistics which show the number of packets and
    bytes both received and transmitted by that function, classified into
    unicast, multicast and broadcast traffic.
  ~ MTD partitions are only exposed from PF0 on each port, hence the utilities
    sfupdate, sfboot and sfkey need to be run where they have access to PF0.
  ~ It is now possible to identify which physical port an interface is bound to.
    See /sys/class/net/<interface>/device/physical_port (note this is zero
    based whereas the identifiers printed on the adapter brackets are one based)
  ~ The driver supports the use of shared RSS indirection tables, after the
    16 unique hardware RSS indirection tables entries have been consumed.
  ~ In order for active-backup bonding to work, the slave interface normally
    takes the MAC address of the master interface. Only PF0 is allowed to
    change its MAC address. Therefore for this to work with other functions it
    is necessary to set "sfboot mac-spoofing=enabled". An alternative is to
    set the bonding module option "fail_over_mac" and allow the gratuitous ARP
    to inform the other link partners of the change in MAC address.
  ~ At this time PTP will only work with the PF0 on each port and will
    not work with a VF.

NIC partitioning support on SFN7XXX adapters:
  ~ The sfc.ko driver will bind to multiple PFs on the same physical adapter
    port and create a network interface for each PF.
  ~ Configure with "sfboot switch-mode=partitioning pf-count=X" and cold reboot
    the server if warned to do so.
  ~ If using NIC partitioning in the same layer2 broadcast domain you may
    need the kernel parameter "arp_ignore=2" as linux will reply to ARP
    on any interface. This might cause traffic to go over unexpected interfaces.
  ~ If using NIC partitioning with VLANs all PFs must be on a unique VLAN
    (which can include VLAN 0). Traffic that is sent/received from this PF will
    have VLAN tags transparently inserted/stripped by the adapter. A single PF
    on each port can be on VLAN0 where it will both receive and transmit
    untagged traffic.
  ~ Configure NIC partitioning with VLANs using
    "sfboot pf-vlans=<VLAN>,<VLAN>..."
  ~ Do not use LACP bonding modes when using NIC partitioning as the LACP
    partner (switch) will not be aware of the partitioning.
  ~ The driver parameter "num_vis" is now more important. This controls how many
    extra VIs (RX/TX/event rings) are allocated for the use of onload on each
    PF. If not using onload you may wish to set "num_vis=0" so that there
    are no false resource limitations when using multiple PFs.
  ~ When PF0 is put into promiscuous mode it will receive traffic for its own
    MAC address as well as any other incoming traffic that does not match
    another PF's MAC address. For other PFs there is no change in received
    traffic if the interface is put into promiscuous mode.

SR-IOV support on SFN7XXX adapters:
  ~ The sfc.ko driver will bind to all VFs and create network interfaces.
  ~ Configure with "sfboot switch-mode=sriov pf-count=1 vf-count=X" and cold
    reboot the server if warned to do so.
  ~ RHEL6.5 and RHEL7 are supported for the host/hypervisor OS.
  ~ It is possible to consume the VFs using these KVM/libirt modes:
     - network hostdev (VF passed into the VM; migration is only possible if
                        the VF is hot-unplugged)
     - direct-passthrough  (macvtap interface used over the VF and virtio-net
                            driver used in the VM guest)
  ~ Note that VFs will initially be assigned random MAC addresses, but libvirt
    (and ip link) can override the MAC address.
  ~ A VF in a VM will be unable to set its own MAC address. See the item on
    active-backup bonding.
  ~ To enable VFs (for RHEL6.5 and RHEL 7)
      echo <num vfs> > /sys/class/ethX/device/sriov_numvfs
  ~ To enable VFs on older operating systems set the sfc.ko module parameter
    "max_vfs". If set to a single integer this is the number of VFs to enable
    and will apply to all PFs. If you wish to configure this to be a different
    value for each PF set this to a comma separated list.
  ~ Please ensure that you enable all BIOS settings that refer to virtualization
    and SR-IOV (note there might be several e.g. SRIOV, IOMMU, VT, VT-x, VT-d,
    IO virtualization)
  ~ Solarflare recommends setting "pci=realloc" as a kernel parameter
    (e.g. in /boot/grub/grub.conf). This allows the kernel to reprogram the
    initial BIOS PCI apertures in case PCI aperture space for the VFs is not
    assigned by the BIOS.
  ~ To view which VFs are associated with which PFs and the VF MAC addresses
    please use "ip link show"
  ~ A PF put into promiscuous mode will not see the traffic to/from a VF.
  ~ A VF put into promiscuous mode will not see any additional traffic.
  ~ Setting VF MAC/VLANs/link state is possible via the ip command
    (or libvirt configuration). From "ip link help"
      "ip link set { dev DEVICE}
         [ vf NUM [ mac LLADDR ]
                  [ vlan VLANID ]
                  [ state { auto | enable | disable} ] ]"
  ~ Setting VF spoofcheck/rate/qos (e.g. via the ip command) is not supported
    at this time.

SR-IOV with NIC partitioning mode support on SFN7XXX adapters:
  ~ This mode offers partitioning of the adapter. Each partition is on a unique
    VLAN and within this layer2 broadcast domain there is switching on the
    adapter between the PF and VFs.
  ~ This support is currently considered EXPERIMENTAL i.e. all features are
    present, but there has only been limited testing. Solarflare will support
    the use of this feature in a test environment, but does not recommend use
    in a production environment until this feature becomes GA.
    Note that both SR-IOV and NIC partitioning as individual features are both
    considered GA quality.
  ~ Ensure you are using adapter firmware >= v4.4.2.1011
  ~ It is necessary to configure NIC partitioning with unique VLANs in this mode
  ~ Configure with:
    "sfboot switch-mode=partitioning-with-sriov \
       pf-count=X  pf-vlans=<VLAN>[,<VLAN>]... \
       vf-count=Y"
    and cold reboot the server if warned to do so.

PF-IOV mode support on SFN7XXX adapters:
  ~ This mode offers switching between PFs. Use this mode where a server does
    not support SR-IOV (otherwise please use SR-IOV mode as this provides up-to
    240VFs versus only 16PFs)
  ~ Configure with "sfboot switch-mode=pfiov pf-count=X" and cold reboot the
    server if warned to do so.
  ~ In RHEL7 passing through a PCI function uses the new VFIO mechanism.
    Due to a missing capability flag on SFN7XXX hardware, VFIO will only allow
    all PFs to be passed into a guest together. This will be addressed with a
    kernel quirk.


Known issues with the platform (KVM/libvirt/kernel)
---------------------------------------------------
  ~ libvirt direct-bridged mode on-top of a VF is not supported. Please use
    libvirt direct-bridged mode over a PF or direct-passthrough mode with VFs.
Issue 46876:
  ~ Multicast does not work in libvirt direct-passthrough mode.
    This is because the multicast address list is not propagated to the network
    interface below the macvtap driver. Without this the sfc.ko driver is unable
    to program the adapter switch to efficiently replicate multicast traffic to
    only the subscribed functions. Solarflare will work with upstream to find a
    solution to this issue.
Issue 47742:
  ~ IPv6 traffic does not pass in direct-bridged and direct-passthrough modes.
    In direct-passthrough mode multicast neighbour solicitation fails as per the
    previous point.
    In direct-bridged mode this is because an interface calculates an IPv6 link
    address based on its MAC address. There will be a neighbour solicitation
    multicast filter in the host, but when a global address is assigned in the
    VM guest, a multicast filter corresponding to the new global address is not
    inserted in the host because macvtap doesn't propagate this information.
Issue 46948:
  ~ The macvtap driver does not propagate the link state from the real network
    interface. This means that it is not possible to use bonded interfaces that
    use link state detection (miimon). Instead please use ARP probes. This
    affects libvirt direct-bridged and direct-passthrough modes.
Issue 47490:
  ~ Bad interactions can occur with NetworkManager scripts when it sees
    new VFs with random MAC addresses. Alternatively use the older networking
    service/scripts.
Issue 53477: Redhat BZ 1222066:
  ~ Currently if pf-count>8 only the lower 8 PF function numbers can be
    successfully passed into a guest. Note that Solarflare recommends using
    VFs where possible to pass PCI functions into guest VMs.


Known Issues with Solarflare driver/firmware
--------------------------------------------
Issue 41550: SF-113649-KI:
  ~ allmulti mode is now correctly supported when using adapter firmware
    >=v4.4.2.1011 and "sfboot firmware-variant=full-feature"
    In other cases only multicast traffic which is not being received by other
    VFs or PFs will be received by the allmulti interface.
  ~ The lack of a proper allmulti mode could be an issue if subscribing to a
    very large number of multicast groups where the number of hardware filters
    is exceeded.
Issue 48214: SF-113650-KI:
  ~ SARFS/SXPS is not compatible with changes in linux >=3.0 and has been
    disabled in this release. In this case please use the kernel ARFS/XPS
    features.
Issue 50308:
  ~ For RHEL 7.0 disabling GRO after passing traffic is unsafe, and can lead to
    a kernel NULL pointer deference. This is believed to be addressed by Redhat
    in RHEL 7.1. This will only happen when LRO is also disabled. For
    configurations that disable GRO and LRO, please disable GRO after the driver
    is loaded, but before the interface is brought up.
Issue 50868:
  ~ If using a SFN7142Q adapter with adapter firmware v4.1.0.6742 and running
    sfupdate, after the update the two network interfaces from the second QSFP+
    port will be in a disabled state. Please reload the driver to correct this.
    This issue has been resolved in adapter firmware >=v4.1.1.1022.
Issue 50873:
  ~ Changing the MTU on a network team in RHEL 7 can cause a hang. As a
    workaround please change the MTU of the component interfaces before
    creating the team.

### v4.2.2.1016 -- Feature release

First release supporting NIC partitioning, SR-IOV and PF-IOV modes on SFN7XXX
adapters. This support requires sfutils >=v4.3.0.1010 which contains adapter
firmware v4.2.1.1014 and firmware-variant=full-feature (setup with sfboot)

General changes:
  ~ the old module parameter "enable_multi_pf" has been removed as NIC
    partitioning (with multiple PFs) is now fully supported by this driver
  ~ add sysfs entry and module parameter to control MCDI tracing between
    the driver and the adapter firmware. This is an extra debug feature that is
    for the use of Solarflare support.

Issue 44671:
  ~ Work around TRIGGER_INTERRUPT command not being supported on SFN7142Q.
Issue 44372:
  ~ Disable RSS on packed stream firmware variant (used for SolarCapture) as it
    is not supported
Issue 44737:
  ~ Increase BIST mode timeout from 10s to 30s to accommodate longer SFN7142Q
    BIST operations.
Issue 46845:
  ~ remove bogus __GFP_COLD flag in page allocation to improve performance.
Issue 47102:
  ~ replace get_page() with atomic_set() to improve performance.
Issue 44509:
  ~ PTP. Fix logical error in efx_ptp_restart()
Issue 44510:
  ~ PTP. To increase robustness, efx_ptp_change_mode() should always disable
    PTP in the firmware if disable is requested even if the driver believes that
    PTP is already stopped
Issue 47551:
  ~ Only fallback to lower interrupt mode if the lower mode is supported.
Issue 47169:
  ~ Kernel compat fixes for RHEL 6.6
Issue 47339:
  ~ Kernel compat for linux 3.16.
Issue 47268:
  ~ Allow for a smaller RX ring to be configured (minimum of 128 reduced to 16)
Issue 47603:
  ~ Move selection of SXPS from compile time to run time.


### v4.1.2.1003 -- Feature release

New features to support the SolarCapture 1.3 release:
   ~ New forward_fcs attribute in sysfs which when enabled, causes the driver to
     not strip CRCs on ingress path. When enabled frames with bad CRCs are not 
     discarded. Changing forward_fcs requires reconfiguring the adapter's MAC
   ~ Disable ARFS if the required adapter filter flags are not supported
   ~ Disable RSS on Packed Stream firmware variant
Other new features:
   ~ Add sysfs entry to control MCDI tracing
   ~ Add module parameter to enable MCDI logging on new functions

Issue 45309:
   ~ Take mac_lock when setting or unsetting the kernel block (from EFVI or
     onload) in order to avoid races in sync_rx_mode.
Issue 44095:
   ~ change EFX_BUG_ON_PARANOID on mcdi failure in ptp_synchronize to a proper
     error path.
Issue 43849:
   ~ recheck mcdi->state after timeout in efx_mcdi_await_completion 
Issue 42806:
   ~ handle nonlinear SKBs in efx_filter_rfs() 
Issue 45444:
   ~ fix calling of free_irq with already free vector 
Issue 40785:
   ~ add module option "underreport_skb_truesize" to falsify skb->truesize for
     LRO packets 
Issue 43391:
   ~ use __GFP_NOWARN when allocating RX pages from atomic context.
Issue 44829:
   ~ don't BUG_ON efx->max_channels == 0 in probe
Issue 46587:
   ~ Add RW semaphore to protect against MCDI timeouts in
     efx_ef10_filter_table_remove() which could cause a kernel panic in
     efx_ef10_filter_table_restore(). There should not be MCDI timeouts seen
     in production systems so this is a defensive fix rather than a bug fix.

### v4.1.0.6734 -- Feature release

New Features:
  ~ Add support for busy polling available in Linux 3.11.
    See section 1.8 of http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.11
    Note that only connect()'ed sockets can make use of this latency reducing
    feature.
  ~ Implement SARFS; Solarflare Accelerated Receive Flow Steering
    (disabled by default) This inserts hardware RX filters in order to direct
    flows back to the same CPU where the user-land process is transmitted. This 
    should help cache locality.
    This feature can be used when Accelerated RFS is not available in the
    currently running kernel, and if ARFS is in use will be disabled.
    To enable SARFS, set the "sarfs_sample_rate module" parameter to non-zero.
    20 is recommended.
    In addition, some form of XPS is needed for SARFS to function correctly. The
    easiest way to do this is to enable Solarflare XPS by setting the module
    parameter "sxps_enabled=1"
    Alternatively if your kernel supports it you can enable XPS by following the
    instructions at:
      https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/scaling.txt
    or in the Solarflare Adapter User Guide (SF-103837-CD) 
      section 3.20 Performance Tuning on Linux

### v4.0.2.6628.1 -- Hot-fix release
  ~ use 64-bit writes for PIO as 32bit PIO writes to write-combined mappings
    can, in very rare circumstances cause data corruption (before TCP checksum
    offload occurs).
    Restrict PIO to x86_64 systems.


### v4.0.2.6628 -- Feature release

Add support for RX time-stamping and PTP on SFN7XXX family adapters:
   ~ This release provides the driver support necessary for both the 
     Solarflare Enhanced PTP daemon ("sfptpd") and linuxptpd which is 
     provided in some distributions.

Issue 37568:
  ~ Properly deliver VLAN-tagged PTP packets when disabling PTP.
Issue 39894:
  ~ Fix DMA unmapping of incorrect addresses for TSO TX buffers on SFN7XXX
    family adapters.
    This bug would be observed as unmap page errors, and would affect users with
    TSO (enabled by default) and an IOMMU enabled.
Issue 38352:
  ~ Remove build time warning message when MTD is disabled, as sfutils can now
    work on linux using an IOCTL to the driver.

### v4.0.0.6585 -- Feature release

Support for SFN7XXX family adapters (using SFC91XX family silicon):
  ~ This release contains full GA quality support for the new SFN7XXX series of
    network adapters.
  ~ Currently running PTP on SFN7XXX adapters is not supported. This support
    will be in a subsequent release in 2013Q4.
  ~ There are new counters exposed via "ethtool -S" to expose any new internal
    packet counters.
  ~ driver support for the "sfkey" utility to modify feature licenses on the
    adapter.

TX improvements:
  ~ Support for SFC91XX TX PIO (Programmed IO) feature for lower TX latency.
    This is controlled by the new module parameter "piobuf_size" (default on
    x86 is 256 bytes). For frames that are smaller than this, and if there are
    adapter resources available, a packet will be transfered directly to the
    adapter via PIO rather than incur the latency of a bus mastered DMA. 

RX improvements:
  ~ The driver now uses a single optimized RX buffer allocation strategy
    (the "rx_alloc_method" module parameter has been deprecated and has no
    effect other than to print a warning).
  ~ Use memory more efficiently by supporting RX scatter for large MTU values
  ~ Make initial fill of RX descriptors synchronous. This is to avoid a non-zero
    "rx_nodesc_drops" count which could previously increment during driver load
    when there was incoming traffic.

Support for POWER systems, including:
  ~ AER/EEH support in the net driver
  ~ Improve performance by reusing DMA-mapped pages
  ~ Improve performance by allocating RX buffers more efficiently in pages of
    memory

Ethtool offline self-test behaviour for SFN7XXX:
  ~ For SFN7XXX series adapters the ethtool offline selftest (which can be used
    to verify hardware operation) can cause operations on other network
    interfaces on the same adapter to fail (as the whole adapter goes into a
    test mode). Only run the ethtool offline self-test on one port at a time,
    and expect to see loss of link for the duration of the test on all ports.
    Note the ethtool online test does not have this limitation.

Issue 39031:
  ~ Remove ethtool RESET operation that could be used by an unpriviledged local
    user to cause a local denial of service.
Issue 31933:
  ~ Cancel interrupt self-test on interface-down on Linux <2.6.23
Issue 36071:
  ~ Avoid kernel warning in skb_try_coalesce
Issue 34973:

Issue 16820:
  ~ Detach network device during reconfiguration to avoid TX watchdog event
Issue 34335:
  ~ Fix driver load failure due to symbols exported on some kernel versions


### v3.3.3.6329 -- Update release

Issue 38482:
  ~ Fix issue in dealing with multicast mismatch present in v3.3.0.6262, which
   was caused by the fix for Issue 31533. This could cause old packet data to
   be received (and hence could look like packet loss, or out-of-order
   packets).

   The bug hits when the following events coincide:
    1) The arrival of a frame that is discarded by the driver.
    2) The receiving channel is in "page-mode" for RX buffer allocation.
    3) The previous packet received has been consumed and freed.

   By default the RX allocation mode is selected automatically by the
   driver according to the traffic profile, and will prefer page-mode when
   packets that can be handled by kernel GRO dominate.

   A workaround for affected drivers is to set the driver parameter
   "rx_alloc_method=1" (to force SKB based allocations).
