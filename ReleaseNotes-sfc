NIC partitioning, SR-IOV and PF-IOV modes on SFN7XXX adapters
-------------------------------------------------------------
This release of the Solarflare Linux Net driver supports NIC partitioning
(multiple PFs) and SR-IOV (VFs).

See "Solarflare Server Adapter User's Guide" SF-103837-CD Issue >=12
available from https://support.solarflare.com for more detailed information
on setting up NIC partitioning, SR-IOV or PF-IOV modes.

Some additional details as well as known issues are documented below:
General:
  ~ NIC partitioning/SRIOV/PF-IOV features require sfutils >=v4.3.0.1010 which
    contains adapter firmware v4.2.1.1014 and firmware-variant=full-feature
    (setup with sfboot)
  ~ Please note that Hybrid SR-IOV support for SFN5XXX|6XXX drivers is now
    deprecated. Please use an older driver to continue using this feature.
  ~ Link control (e.g. setting pause frames with ethtool and controlling MTU) is
    only available on the first PF on each port; (this is referred to as "PF0"
    or the "primary PF")
  ~ Only link control functions have the full MAC statistics available to them
    (via ethtool -S). All statistics that come from the MAC are now prefixed
    "port_" as they refer to a single physical network port.
    All other functions have statistics which show the number of packets and
    bytes both received and transmitted by that function, classified into
    unicast, multicast and broadcast traffic.
  ~ MTD partitions are only exposed from PF0 on each port, hence the utilities
    sfupdate, sfboot and sfkey need to be run where they have access to PF0.
  ~ It is now possible to identify which physical port an interface is bound to.
    See /sys/class/net/<interface>/device/physical_port (note this is zero
    based whereas the identifiers printed on the adapter brackets are one based)
  ~ The driver supports the use of shared RSS indirection tables, after the
    16 unique hardware RSS indirection tables entries have been consumed.
  ~ In order for active-backup bonding to work, the slave interface normally
    takes the MAC address of the master interface. Only PF0 is allowed to
    change its MAC address. Therefore for this to work with other functions it
    is necessary to set "sfboot mac-spoofing=enabled". An alternative is to
    set the bonding module option "fail_over_mac" and allow the gratuitous ARP
    to inform the other link partners of the change in MAC address.
  ~ At this time PTP will only work with the PF0 on each port and will
    not work with a VF.

NIC partitioning support on SFN7XXX adapters:
  ~ The sfc.ko driver will bind to multiple PFs on the same physical adapter
    port and create a network interface for each PF.
  ~ Configure with "sfboot switch-mode=partitioning pf-count=X" and cold reboot
    the server if warned to do so.
  ~ If using NIC partitioning in the same layer2 broadcast domain you may
    need the kernel parameter "arp_ignore=2" as linux will reply to ARP
    on any interface. This might cause traffic to go over unexpected interfaces.
  ~ If using NIC partitioning with VLANs all PFs must be on a unique VLAN
    (which can include VLAN 0). Traffic that is sent/received from this PF will
    have VLAN tags transparently inserted/stripped by the adapter. A single PF
    on each port can be on VLAN0 where it will both receive and transmit
    untagged traffic.
  ~ Configure NIC partitioning with VLANs using
    "sfboot pf-vlans=<VLAN>,<VLAN>..."
  ~ Do not use LACP bonding modes when using NIC partitioning as the LACP
    partner (switch) will not be aware of the partitioning.
  ~ The driver parameter "num_vis" is now more important. This controls how many
    extra VIs (RX/TX/event rings) are allocated for the use of onload on each
    PF. If not using onload you may wish to set "num_vis=0" so that there
    are no false resource limitations when using multiple PFs.
  ~ When PF0 is put into promiscuous mode it will receive traffic for its own
    MAC address as well as any other incoming traffic that does not match
    another PF's MAC address. For other PFs there is no change in received
    traffic if the interface is put into promiscuous mode.

SR-IOV support on SFN7XXX adapters:
  ~ The sfc.ko driver will bind to all VFs and create network interfaces.
  ~ Configure with "sfboot switch-mode=sriov pf-count=1 vf-count=X" and cold
    reboot the server if warned to do so.
  ~ RHEL6.5 and RHEL7 are supported for the host/hypervisor OS.
  ~ It is possible to consume the VFs using these KVM/libirt modes:
     - network hostdev (VF passed into the VM; migration is only possible if
                        the VF is hot-unplugged)
     - direct-passthrough  (macvtap interface used over the VF and virtio-net
                            driver used in the VM guest)
  ~ Note that VFs will initially be assigned random MAC addresses, but libvirt
    (and ip link) can override the MAC address.
  ~ A VF in a VM will be unable to set its own MAC address. See the item on
    active-backup bonding.
  ~ To enable VFs (for RHEL6.5 and RHEL 7)
      echo <num vfs> > /sys/class/ethX/device/sriov_numvfs
  ~ To enable VFs on older operating systems set the sfc.ko module parameter
    "max_vfs". If set to a single integer this is the number of VFs to enable
    and will apply to all PFs. If you wish to configure this to be a different
    value for each PF set this to a comma separated list.
  ~ Please ensure that you enable all BIOS settings that refer to virtualization
    and SR-IOV (note there might be several e.g. SRIOV, IOMMU, VT, VT-x, VT-d,
    IO virtualization)
  ~ Solarflare recommends setting "pci=realloc" as a kernel parameter
    (e.g. in /boot/grub/grub.conf). This allows the kernel to reprogram the
    initial BIOS PCI apertures in case PCI aperture space for the VFs is not
    assigned by the BIOS.
  ~ To view which VFs are associated with which PFs and the VF MAC addresses
    please use "ip link show"
  ~ A PF put into promiscuous mode will not see the traffic to/from a VF.
  ~ A VF put into promiscuous mode will not see any additional traffic.
  ~ Setting VF MAC/VLANs/link state is possible via the ip command
    (or libvirt configuration). From "ip link help"
      "ip link set { dev DEVICE}
         [ vf NUM [ mac LLADDR ]
                  [ vlan VLANID ]
                  [ state { auto | enable | disable} ] ]"
  ~ Setting VF spoofcheck/rate/qos (e.g. via the ip command) is not supported
    at this time.

SR-IOV with NIC partitioning mode support on SFN7XXX adapters:
  ~ This mode offers partitioning of the adapter. Each partition is on a unique
    VLAN and within this layer2 broadcast domain there is switching on the
    adapter between the PF and VFs.
  ~ This support is currently considered EXPERIMENTAL i.e. all features are
    present, but there has only been limited testing. Solarflare will support
    the use of this feature in a test environment, but does not recommend use
    in a production environment until this feature becomes GA.
    Note that both SR-IOV and NIC partitioning as individual features are both
    considered GA quality.
  ~ Ensure you are using adapter firmware >= v4.4.2.1011
  ~ It is necessary to configure NIC partitioning with unique VLANs in this mode
  ~ Configure with:
    "sfboot switch-mode=partitioning-with-sriov \
       pf-count=X  pf-vlans=<VLAN>[,<VLAN>]... \
       vf-count=Y"
    and cold reboot the server if warned to do so.

PF-IOV mode support on SFN7XXX adapters:
  ~ This mode offers switching between PFs. Use this mode where a server does
    not support SR-IOV (otherwise please use SR-IOV mode as this provides up-to
    240VFs versus only 16PFs)
  ~ Configure with "sfboot switch-mode=pfiov pf-count=X" and cold reboot the
    server if warned to do so.
  ~ In RHEL7 passing through a PCI function uses the new VFIO mechanism.
    Due to a missing capability flag on SFN7XXX hardware, VFIO will only allow
    all PFs to be passed into a guest together. This will be addressed with a
    kernel quirk.


Known issues with the platform (KVM/libvirt/kernel)
---------------------------------------------------
  ~ libvirt direct-bridged mode on-top of a VF is not supported. Please use
    libvirt direct-bridged mode over a PF or direct-passthrough mode with VFs.
Issue 46876:
  ~ Multicast does not work in libvirt direct-passthrough mode.
    This is because the multicast address list is not propagated to the network
    interface below the macvtap driver. Without this the sfc.ko driver is unable
    to program the adapter switch to efficiently replicate multicast traffic to
    only the subscribed functions. Solarflare will work with upstream to find a
    solution to this issue.
Issue 47742:
  ~ IPv6 traffic does not pass in direct-bridged and direct-passthrough modes.
    In direct-passthrough mode multicast neighbour solicitation fails as per the
    previous point.
    In direct-bridged mode this is because an interface calculates an IPv6 link
    address based on its MAC address. There will be a neighbour solicitation
    multicast filter in the host, but when a global address is assigned in the
    VM guest, a multicast filter corresponding to the new global address is not
    inserted in the host because macvtap doesn't propagate this information.
Issue 46948:
  ~ The macvtap driver does not propagate the link state from the real network
    interface. This means that it is not possible to use bonded interfaces that
    use link state detection (miimon). Instead please use ARP probes. This
    affects libvirt direct-bridged and direct-passthrough modes.
Issue 47490:
  ~ Bad interactions can occur with NetworkManager scripts when it sees
    new VFs with random MAC addresses. Alternatively use the older networking
    service/scripts.
Issue 50308:
  ~ For RHEL 7.0 disabling GRO after passing traffic is unsafe, and can lead to
    a kernel NULL pointer deference. This is believed to be addressed by Redhat
    in RHEL 7.1. This will only happen when LRO is also disabled. For
    configurations that disable GRO and LRO, please disable GRO after the driver
    is loaded, but before the interface is brought up.
Issue 50873:
  ~ Changing the MTU across the page size (4K for x86) on a network team in
    RHEL 7.0 can cause a hang. As a workaround please change the MTU of the
    component interfaces of the team before creating it. This is fixed in
    RHEL 7.1


Known Issues with Solarflare driver/firmware
--------------------------------------------
Issue 48214: SF-113650-KI:
  ~ SARFS/SXPS is not compatible with changes in linux >=3.0 and has been
    disabled in this release. In this case please use the kernel ARFS/XPS
    features.
Issue 50868:
  ~ If using a SFN7142Q adapter with adapter firmware v4.1.0.6742 and running
    sfupdate, after the update the two network interfaces from the second QSFP+
    port will be in a disabled state. Please reload the driver to correct this.
    This issue has been resolved in adapter firmware >=v4.1.1.1022.


Changelog
---------

### v4.8.2.1004 -- GA release adding support for SFN8x22 adapters.

[SFN8522 support]
 ~ Added full support for SFN8522 series Solarflare adapters.
 ~ BETA quality support for stateless checksum offloads for NVGRE,VXLAN,GENEVE
   tunnels created as native linux tunnels or as OpenVSwitch (OVS) tunnels.
 ~ Please note that SFN8x42 40G QSFP+ adapters are still going through a test
   cycle at this time and driver/firmware updates will be made available to
   accompany the GA of these products.
 ~ Use 4K PIO buffers on SFN8XXX adapters.
 ~ Adds a module parameter "performance_profile" to allow selection of
   broad tuning options, allowing selection of low latency ('latency') or
   high throughput ('throughput') profiles. The default is 'auto', in
   which the profile is selected based off licensed options on the NIC.
   At present this only changes the event queue initialization options on 8000
   series adapters.

[BETA support for overlays/tunnels/encapsulation on SFN8XXX adapters]
 ~ Add support for encapsulated TSO for 8000 series NICs.
 ~ Add message when adapter resets due to VXLAN port list change.
 ~ Add debugfs entry "vxlan_ports" to print the list of VXLAN ports.

[onload]
Issue 62104:
 ~ More conservatively account for the number of wakeup events that the driver
   might have to handle, one for each possible onload stack. This prevents
   event queue overflows in rare cases.


### v4.8.0.1071 -- Beta feature release
[General changes]
 ~ BETA quality driver support for SFN8XXX series adapters.
   Please DO NOT use this driver in production environments as it has not
   completed the full suite of testing at Solarflare.
 ~ Support for checksum offloads in the presense of encapsulation/overlay
   networks (tunnels) on SFN8XXX hardware. Outer frames of
   (NV)GRE / VxLAN / GENEVE are supported.
 ~ Support for more efficient TSO on SFN8XXX adapters.
 ~ Use symmetric RSS hash by default.
   This is most useful when sniffing both sides of a TCP conversation. This
   ensures that all packets are directed to the same RX queue and all are
   handled in-order.
 ~ Add "tso_version" and "csum_offload" to TX queue information in debugfs.
 ~ Attach hardware RX timestamps to SKBs in GRO and LRO code-paths.
 ~ Support IPv6 flow-steering in ethtool rxnfc API (still needs support in
   ethtool)
 ~ Support encap-over-IPv6 in ethtool n-tuple API (still needs support in
   ethtool)
 ~ Support for SKB xmit_more flags in compatible kernels.
 ~ Change to use the 4-tuple UDP RSS hashing, as the resulting hash value will
   help improve GRO performance.
 ~ Read adadpter PCIe configuration to warn on PCIe lane width or speed not
   being optimal for the adapter in use.

[EF-VI support]
 ~ Do not treat a broadcast filter as exclusive in filter logic.
   This prevented ef_vi from installing >1 UDP filter with the local IP set
   to broadcast.

[Stratus ftServer support]
Issue 57944:
 ~ Take a read lock on the filter table when performing driverlink (onload/EFVI)
   operations on filters; as there was a possible NULL pointer dereference if
   there was a race with PCIe hot-plug.

[General fixes]
Issue 62086:
 ~ On MC reset (e.g. running sfupdate or ethtool -t offline tests), clear PIO
   buffer linkage in TXQs. Otherwise, if we fail to allocate new PIO buffers,
   TXQs will try to use the old deallocated PIO buffers and this will cause an
   error.

Issue 58215:
 ~ Remove suprious WARNING from efx_hard_start_xmit() seen after "ethtool -t"
   off-line self-tests. Use of "ethtool -t" can be identified from
   "MC entered BIST mode" in the kernel log.

Issue 57217:
 ~ Fix taking the network interface into promiscuous (or allmulti) mode when
   running with low-latency firmware variant.
     i.e "sfboot firmware-variant=ultra-low-latency".
   The error message seen would be:
     Unicast mismatch filter insert failed rc=-93
     Multicast mismatch filter insert failed rc=-93

Issue 41741:
 ~ Implement shutdown() driver entry point. This helps quiesce the Solarflare
   adapter when using kexec to transition to a new kernel. This issue was seen
   on IBM POWER machines that raised EEH errors during the kexec.

Issue 33781:
 ~ "ethtool -S" statistic "port_rx_bad_bytes" was not being correctly reset in
   all cases.


### v4.7.1.1000 -- Update release
[General changes]
 ~ Build fixes for linux 4.5 kernels.
 ~ Provide an option to place external network port PHY into power down when the
   network interface is administratively down. This means the link partner also
   sees link down. Currently this is controlled via an ethtool private flag:
    - To enable/disable:
       ethtool --set-priv-flags DEVNAME phy-power-follows-link (on|off)
    - To show current state:
       ethtool --show-priv-flags DEVNAME
 ~ support IPv6 flow steering (needs ethtool support that is not yet released).

Issue 53130
 ~ Create MTD partitions (to allow sfupdate) even if NVRAM metadata cannot
    be successfully read.

[Stratus ftServer support]
Issue 60796:
 ~ Fix efx_mcdi_acquire_sync() returning -ETIMEDOUT on impolite unplug.


### v4.7.0.1035 -- Update release

[General changes]
 ~ expose SFA7942Q flash partitions via MTD (to speed up sfupdate)
 ~ Include Stratus ftServer improvements from v4.5.1.1037
 ~ Use timespec64 if available for y2038 compatibility.

Issue 59734:
 ~ Fix detection of PHC so that /dev/ptp* is registered on SLES11/12

Issue 59701 & 58885:
 ~ Take the mac_lock in efx_ef10_sriov_set_vf_mac()
   This fixes a kernel panic in efx_ef10_filter_vlan_sync_rx_mode() when
   using SR-IOV direct pass-thru mode.


### v4.7.0.1031 -- Feature release 

[General changes]
 ~ Support adapter firmware state dump via ethtool.
 ~ Set IRQ interrupt hints for 3.x kernels. The irqbalance service using
   policy=strict will follow these hints.
 ~ NAPI budget now only applies to receive processing (previously TX completion
   and other internal events were incorrectly counted towards the budget).
 ~ Use symmetric RSS hash key by default. This allows applications such as IDS
   to ensure that both directions of a TCP stream will be spread via RSS to
   the same channel.
 ~ Implement VLAN filtering. (only on full-featured adapter firmware variant)

[SR-IOV]
 ~ Implement sriov_set_vf_spoofchk() for SFN7XXX adapters.

[Performance]
 ~ Automatically configure XPS at driver load (on kernels where this is
   supported).
 ~ Implement IRQ notifiers so that XPS can match any changes to interrupt
   affinity.
 ~ Report TX completions to BQL after all TX events from an interrupt/NAPI poll.
   This gives a significant improvement to UDP transaction rates using RHEL7 or
   SLES12 kernels.
 ~ read EVQ in cache line batches.
 ~ allocate rx pages on the same node as the interrupt.
 ~ Improve performance when the driver is asked to add/strip VLAN tags for
   linux kernels >=3.0.

[General VMware ESXi support]
Issue 43845:
  ~ Avoid installation of duplicate default unicast and multicast Rx filters.
Issue 57409:
  ~ Disable RSS by default ('num_rss_netqs' module parameter with value greater
    than zero may be used to enable RSS on specified number of NetQueues).

[Support SR-IOV on VMware ESXi 5.5 and 6.0]
First release supporting SR-IOV on VMware ESXi (SFN7xxx adapters only).
This support requires sfutils >=v4.7.0.1004 which contains adapter firmware
v4.7.0.1019 and firmware-variant=full-feature (setup with sfboot).
See chapter "SR-IOV Virtualization Using ESXi" of the "Solarflare Server
Adapter User's Guide".
  ~ Support 'max_vfs' module parameter to request specified number of VFs
    for each PF.
  ~ Enforce PF promiscuous mode if VFs are requested (required on ESXi 5.5 only
    since ESXi 6.0 enforces this itself).
  ~ Support VF MAC address configuration; security settings of the port group
    that the VM network interface belongs to should be used to control it.
  ~ Support VF default VLAN tagging done by the NIC.
  ~ Support VF anti-spoofing control configured as "allow/deny forged
    transmits" in security settings of the port group the VM network interface
    belongs to.
  ~ Support reading VF statistics from the hypervisor (for example,
    esxcli network sriovnic vf stats -n vmnic2 -v 0).
  ~ Support MTU change requested on VF, if allowed by hypervisor. This is
    configurable in VM network interface settings.
  ~ Support VF promiscuous mode, if allowed by hypervisor (ESXi 6.0 only).
  ~ Support VF VLAN membership control by hypervisor; only untagged traffic
    is allowed by default.

Issue 51699:
 ~ Fix lockdep warning on driver unload.

Issue 56887:
  ~ Fix memory leak for EFX_MCDI_REQUEST private ioctl calls e.g. from sfupdate.

Issue 56934:
  ~ avoid rx copybreak on GRO tail packet to avoid potential reordering.


### v4.5.1.1038 -- Update release

[Stratus ftServer support]
Issue 59975:
  ~ Add workaround for loss of RX doorbell in a "breaker" test.

### v4.5.1.1037 -- Update release

[General changes]
  ~ Support for linux v4.3
  ~ Simplify locking when CONFIG_NET_RX_BUSY_POLL is enabled (~20ns latency win)
  ~ Make RSS hashing symmetric by default.
    The key chosen has been shown to provide good spreading as well as being
    symmetric. Symmetry is important for applications that sniff both
    directions of TCP conversations (eg. IDS and other security apps).
  ~ Support for Solarflare SFA7942Q QSFP+ AOE Adapter (but please use
    specific packages that are targeted at this adapter).

Issue 55559:
  ~ Cleanup IRQ affinity hints correctly in probe failure path which
    caused this warning:
    "WARNING: at kernel/irq/manage.c:1221 __free_irq+0x19a/0x1e0()"

Issue 56887:
  ~ Fix small memory leak on every EFX_MCDI_REQUEST private ioctl call.

Issue 56934:
  ~ Avoid rx copybreak on GRO tail packet.
  ~ If a fragmented TCP packet is being handled by GRO, rx copybreak should not
    be used on any small tail fragment as this can result in packets being
    delivered out of order. These small fragments could benefit from
    reassembly in GRO if part of a stream of larger packets.

[OpenOnload support]
Issue 57548:
  ~ IPv4 broadcast address should not be treated as exclusive.
  ~ this allows ef_vi to install >1 UDP filters with a local broadcast IP.

[Stratus ftServer OpenOnload support]
  ~ Further work to strengthen driver robustness on surprise device
    removal; especially when OpenOnload is being used.
Issue 53701:
  ~ Support changing MAC address with filters installed.
    This is required for OpenOnload to add new slaves to a bond.

    limitation that onload could only use interrupts on the local NUMA node.

Issue 54840:
  ~ Fix efx_ef10_filter_is_exclusive() which did not identify the ethertype and
    IP-protocol filters as exclusive.

Issue 55443:

  ~ Rework allocation of TX queues to allow driver to take advantage of
    upcoming firmware performance improvements on SFN7142Q adapters in 2*40G
    mode.

[Stratus ftServer support]
   ~ Introduce support for Stratus ftServers (including polite and impolite
     removal cases). Driver module parameter 'monitor_interval_ms'
     (default 200ms) is used to test see if a PCIe isolation event has occurred.

### v4.2.2.1016 -- Feature release

First release supporting NIC partitioning, SR-IOV and PF-IOV modes on SFN7XXX
adapters. This support requires sfutils >=v4.3.0.1010 which contains adapter
firmware v4.2.1.1014 and firmware-variant=full-feature (setup with sfboot)

General changes:
  ~ the old module parameter "enable_multi_pf" has been removed as NIC
    partitioning (with multiple PFs) is now fully supported by this driver
  ~ add sysfs entry and module parameter to control MCDI tracing between
    the driver and the adapter firmware. This is an extra debug feature that is
    for the use of Solarflare support.

Issue 44671:
  ~ Work around TRIGGER_INTERRUPT command not being supported on SFN7142Q.
Issue 44372:
  ~ Disable RSS on packed stream firmware variant (used for SolarCapture) as it
    is not supported
Issue 44737:
  ~ Increase BIST mode timeout from 10s to 30s to accommodate longer SFN7142Q
    BIST operations.
Issue 46845:
  ~ remove bogus __GFP_COLD flag in page allocation to improve performance.
Issue 47102:
  ~ replace get_page() with atomic_set() to improve performance.
Issue 44509:
  ~ PTP. Fix logical error in efx_ptp_restart()
Issue 44510:
  ~ PTP. To increase robustness, efx_ptp_change_mode() should always disable
    PTP in the firmware if disable is requested even if the driver believes that
    PTP is already stopped
Issue 47551:
  ~ Only fallback to lower interrupt mode if the lower mode is supported.
Issue 47169:
  ~ Kernel compat fixes for RHEL 6.6
Issue 47339:
  ~ Kernel compat for linux 3.16.
Issue 47268:
  ~ Allow for a smaller RX ring to be configured (minimum of 128 reduced to 16)
Issue 47603:
  ~ Move selection of SXPS from compile time to run time.


### v4.1.2.1003 -- Feature release

New features to support the SolarCapture 1.3 release:
   ~ New forward_fcs attribute in sysfs which when enabled, causes the driver to
     not strip CRCs on ingress path. When enabled frames with bad CRCs are not 
     discarded. Changing forward_fcs requires reconfiguring the adapter's MAC
   ~ Disable ARFS if the required adapter filter flags are not supported
   ~ Disable RSS on Packed Stream firmware variant
Other new features:
   ~ Add sysfs entry to control MCDI tracing
   ~ Add module parameter to enable MCDI logging on new functions

Issue 45309:
   ~ Take mac_lock when setting or unsetting the kernel block (from EFVI or
     onload) in order to avoid races in sync_rx_mode.
Issue 44095:
   ~ change EFX_BUG_ON_PARANOID on mcdi failure in ptp_synchronize to a proper
     error path.

   ~ handle nonlinear SKBs in efx_filter_rfs() 
Issue 45444:
   ~ fix calling of free_irq with already free vector 
Issue 40785:
   ~ add module option "underreport_skb_truesize" to falsify skb->truesize for
     LRO packets 
Issue 43391:
   ~ use __GFP_NOWARN when allocating RX pages from atomic context.
Issue 44829:
   ~ don't BUG_ON efx->max_channels == 0 in probe
Issue 46587:
   ~ Add RW semaphore to protect against MCDI timeouts in
     efx_ef10_filter_table_remove() which could cause a kernel panic in
     efx_ef10_filter_table_restore(). There should not be MCDI timeouts seen
     in production systems so this is a defensive fix rather than a bug fix.


### v4.1.0.6734B -- Update release for VMware ESXi

Issue 51531:
  ~ Some ethtool operations could cause an RTNL deadlock. This could be
    experienced when running ethtool from the command line or if openmanage
    is installed. This can cause a hang when the adapters page is opened in
    vSphere.


### v4.1.0.6734A -- Update release for VMware ESXi

Issue 44988:
  ~ Use receive ring with 512 entries by default to consume less packet buffers.
  ~ Change default number of NetQueues from 4 to 8.
Issue 46436:
  ~ If available, put RSS hash information to skb.


### v4.1.0.6734 -- Feature release

New Features:
  ~ Add support for busy polling available in Linux 3.11.
    See section 1.8 of http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.11
    Note that only connect()'ed sockets can make use of this latency reducing
    feature.
  ~ Implement SARFS; Solarflare Accelerated Receive Flow Steering
    (disabled by default) This inserts hardware RX filters in order to direct
    flows back to the same CPU where the user-land process is transmitted. This 
    should help cache locality.
    This feature can be used when Accelerated RFS is not available in the
    currently running kernel, and if ARFS is in use will be disabled.
    To enable SARFS, set the "sarfs_sample_rate module" parameter to non-zero.
    20 is recommended.
    In addition, some form of XPS is needed for SARFS to function correctly. The
    easiest way to do this is to enable Solarflare XPS by setting the module
    parameter "sxps_enabled=1"
    Alternatively if your kernel supports it you can enable XPS by following the
    instructions at:
      https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/scaling.txt
    or in the Solarflare Adapter User Guide (SF-103837-CD) 
      section 3.20 Performance Tuning on Linux
  ~ 7xxx: Add support for SFC9140 40G QSFP network controller silicon.
    (network adapter part number SFN7142Q).
  ~ Preferentially affinitise interrupts to CPUs on the NUMA node local to the
    adapter and restrict RSS to only local CPUs (disabled by default).
    To enable this feature set the module parameter "rss_numa_local=1"
  ~ add RX hook for driverlink to allow Solarsecure Filter Engine to inspect
    packets.

PTP issues/features:
Issue 35011: 
  ~ PTP: Use net_ratelimit() for PTP event queue overflow messages.
Issue 41277: 
  ~ PTP: Advertise translated hardware timestamps.
Issue 41479:

  ~ PTP: Fix preprocessor conditions using EFX_HAVE_PHC_SUPPORT
  ~ PTP: Always request 'enhanced' PTPv2 filtering on Siena
  ~ PTP: Switch back to the original PTP clock adjustment operation
Issue 41335:
  ~ PTP: Accept fake PPS events whether or not packet timestamping of PTP
    packets is enabled in the NIC. This allows phc2sys to be used without
    requiring linuxptp to be running
Issue 42466: 
 ~ PTP: check for NULL efx->ptp_data in efx_ptp_event
Issue 42956:
  ~ PTP: Test for ethtool get_ts_info support directly
Issue 41055:
  ~ PTP: Check for non-PTP or non-primary function in private clock ioctls
  ~ In some cases this could cause a kernel NULL pointer dereference in
    efx_ptp_ts_settime() when calling ioctl(SIOCSHWTSTAMP)
Issue 41022:
  ~ PTP: Fix kernel NULL pointer dereference in efx_hard_start_xmit() that could
    be caused if hardware timestamping on raw sockets were enabled.
Issue 40999:
  ~ PTP: Expose ptp_caps on primary function, not all functions on port 0
Issue 42321:
  ~ 7xxx: PTP. Fix issue that can cause firmware watchdog to expire while host
    compares system and NIC clocks.

Driver support for OpenOnload / EFVI / SolarSecure Filtering Engine:
Issue 40538:
  ~ onload: multicast loopback: net_driver filter support
  ~ onload: net_driver filter support for stack_id
Issue 41295:
  ~ Updates driver link filter_block_kernel API (used by onload and EFVI apps)
    to have a unicast/multicast split, to allow for a closer match to previous
    semantics.
Issue 41992:

    cleanup actions performed during hardware setup.
Issue 40373:
  ~ rewrite pcie_enable_error_reporting error to be less alarming
    (normally when AER cannot be enabled as the platform firmware is handling
    this)
Issue 39820:
  ~ Don't count discarded packets as checksum errors as well.
Issue 39528:
  ~ Improve 'Fatal error' logs which occur when MC reboot is detected
Issue 43431:
  ~ Make ethtool_set_flags understand rxvlan and txvlan offload options

### v4.0.2.6640 -- VMware ESXi feature release

Support VMware ESXi 5.5:
  ~ Support SFN5xxx/SFN6xxx and SFN7xxx.
  ~ Support VLAN tagging on transmit and stripping on receive in driver.
  ~ Support paired NetQueue feature which says that transmit and receive
    NetQueues with the same number share event queue/interrupt.
  ~ Support dynamic NetQueue feature which allows dynamically allocalte
    NetQueue with specified features.
  ~ Support RSS NetQueue feature.
  ~ Support preemptible NetQueue feature which allows to reallocation of
    a NetQueue with different features.
  ~ Support dynamic RSS NetQueue feature which allows ESXi kernel to
    configure RSS hash key and indirection table.
  ~ Remove 'rss_vlans' module parameter since RSS NetQueue feature is supported.
  ~ Support 'netq_force_rss' module parameter to enforce RSS on all applicable
    NetQueues.
  ~ Support 'num_rss_netqs' module parameter to control number of NetQueues
    with RSS support (one by default on ESXi 5.1 and newer version, zero on
    earlier versions).
  ~ Support LRO and corresponding NetQueue feature which allows to control LRO
    enabled/disabled when NetQueue is allocated.
  ~ Support 'netq_force_lro' module parameter to force LRO on all NetQueues
    including default one.

### v4.0.2.6628.1 -- Hot-fix release
  ~ use 64-bit writes for PIO as 32bit PIO writes to write-combined mappings
    can, in very rare circumstances cause data corruption (before TCP checksum
    offload occurs).
    Restrict PIO to x86_64 systems.


### v4.0.2.6628 -- Feature release

Add support for RX time-stamping and PTP on SFN7XXX family adapters:
   ~ This release provides the driver support necessary for both the 
     Solarflare Enhanced PTP daemon ("sfptpd") and linuxptpd which is 
     provided in some distributions.

Issue 37568:
  ~ Properly deliver VLAN-tagged PTP packets when disabling PTP.
Issue 39894:
  ~ Fix DMA unmapping of incorrect addresses for TSO TX buffers on SFN7XXX
    family adapters.
    This bug would be observed as unmap page errors, and would affect users with
    TSO (enabled by default) and an IOMMU enabled.
Issue 38352:
  ~ Remove build time warning message when MTD is disabled, as sfutils can now
    work on linux using an IOCTL to the driver.


### v4.0.0.6585 -- Feature release

Support for SFN7XXX family adapters (using SFC91XX family silicon):
  ~ This release contains full GA quality support for the new SFN7XXX series of
    network adapters.
  ~ Currently running PTP on SFN7XXX adapters is not supported. This support
    will be in a subsequent release in 2013Q4.
  ~ There are new counters exposed via "ethtool -S" to expose any new internal
    packet counters.
  ~ driver support for the "sfkey" utility to modify feature licenses on the
    adapter.

TX improvements:
  ~ Support for SFC91XX TX PIO (Programmed IO) feature for lower TX latency.
    This is controlled by the new module parameter "piobuf_size" (default on
    x86 is 256 bytes). For frames that are smaller than this, and if there are
    adapter resources available, a packet will be transfered directly to the
    adapter via PIO rather than incur the latency of a bus mastered DMA. 

RX improvements:
  ~ The driver now uses a single optimized RX buffer allocation strategy
    (the "rx_alloc_method" module parameter has been deprecated and has no
    effect other than to print a warning).
  ~ Use memory more efficiently by supporting RX scatter for large MTU values
  ~ Make initial fill of RX descriptors synchronous. This is to avoid a non-zero
    "rx_nodesc_drops" count which could previously increment during driver load
    when there was incoming traffic.

Support for POWER systems, including:
  ~ AER/EEH support in the net driver
  ~ Improve performance by reusing DMA-mapped pages
  ~ Improve performance by allocating RX buffers more efficiently in pages of
    memory

Ethtool offline self-test behaviour for SFN7XXX:
  ~ For SFN7XXX series adapters the ethtool offline selftest (which can be used
    to verify hardware operation) can cause operations on other network
    interfaces on the same adapter to fail (as the whole adapter goes into a
    test mode). Only run the ethtool offline self-test on one port at a time,
    and expect to see loss of link for the duration of the test on all ports.
    Note the ethtool online test does not have this limitation.

Issue 39031:
  ~ Remove ethtool RESET operation that could be used by an unpriviledged local
    user to cause a local denial of service.
Issue 31933:
  ~ Cancel interrupt self-test on interface-down on Linux <2.6.23
Issue 36071:
  ~ Avoid kernel warning in skb_try_coalesce
Issue 34973:
  ~ Fix RX buffer handling on non-x86 and non-POWER systems
Issue 35013:
  ~ Fix potential kernel panic when using certain (uncommon) MTU values
Issue 35019:
  ~ Fix build failure on RHEL5 kernel
Issue 34716:
  ~ Fix rare memory leak on RX data path
Issue 33921 / 33922:
  ~ Fix RX filter insertion conflicts
Issue 34253:
  ~ Disable AOE on RHEL4 to fix build failure
Issue 34299:
  ~ Fix potential flood of syslog if PTP packet storm occurs
Issue 16820:
  ~ Detach network device during reconfiguration to avoid TX watchdog event
Issue 34335:
  ~ Fix driver load failure due to symbols exported on some kernel versions


### v3.3.3.6329 -- Update release

Issue 38482:
  ~ Fix issue in dealing with multicast mismatch present in v3.3.0.6262, which
   was caused by the fix for Issue 31533. This could cause old packet data to
   be received (and hence could look like packet loss, or out-of-order
   packets).

   The bug hits when the following events coincide:
    1) The arrival of a frame that is discarded by the driver.
    2) The receiving channel is in "page-mode" for RX buffer allocation.
    3) The previous packet received has been consumed and freed.

   By default the RX allocation mode is selected automatically by the
   driver according to the traffic profile, and will prefer page-mode when
   packets that can be handled by kernel GRO dominate.

   A workaround for affected drivers is to set the driver parameter
   "rx_alloc_method=1" (to force SKB based allocations).
Issue 37963:
  ~ Allow PTP to work with vlans post 2.6.37
Issue 37405:
  ~  Add kernel compat for RHEL 6.5 backport of ARFS


### v3.3.0.6309 -- Update release

Issue 34948:
  ~ Fix CPU soft-lockup on interrupted self-test
